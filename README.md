PROJECT NAME : YODHA-fighting_breast_cancer

This app will be available for all under three categories:
 1. Not a breast cancer patient
 2. Breast cancer patient
 3. Survivors

WORKFLOW

On Startup we will ask the user to provide us his/her email and an option to receive important articles about breast cancer we will also use it for analytics purpose.
Next we will ask the user if he/she is not a cancer patient but doubts that they have those symptoms OR if they’re breast cancer patient OR they’ve won th fight against breast cancer.

-> Workflow for non-cancer patients:

We will gather information from the user regarding the risk factors that are involved in breast cancer.
Risk factors are gender, age, family history, early menarche, late menopause, late first child, genetic mutation, diet, obesity, smoking, alcohol, sedentary lifestyle, physically active, taking hormone therapy, recently used oral contraceptive, personal history of breast cancer or some other disease, radiation therapy to chest, skin changes such as swelling redness or other visible changes on breasts or around armpits, changes in appearance of nipples, nipple discharge other than breast milk, general pain in any part of breast, lumps or nodes on breast, irritation or itchy breasts, change in breast color, peeling or flaking of nipple skin, changes on touch.
Then after we have all data regarding above factors from the user we compute the risk they’re at of having breast cancer using machine learning and on the next screen display the result. Under the result we will give the option to know more about breast cancer symptoms, diagnosis and treatment.
And under this we will give them an option to call a doctor or nurse who is expert in breast cancer and he can take counselling from the free of cost and get the much needed guidance at an early stage.

-> Workflow for cancer patients:

If user selects the option that he’s a cancer patient then we will ask him the type of cancer and the stage of cancer. A cancer patient is deeply affected by depression and other psychological issues So we will collect few data from the user about how he feels to calculate the levels of depression and based on that we will show him the best coping strategies suited for them. Based on their cancer type and stage we will show them what daily routine the should follow for better results in other section. There will be a section that will have the short motivational stories of survivors.

-> Workflow for survivors:

If the user selects the option of survivor we will ask him which type of cancer they had, which surgery the went through and when was the last time they went for mammography from this data we can send him notification for diagnosing through the app or on his email after appropriate time (once per year or twice) because many of them forget to go for a checkup.
We will compute their depression level by machine learning as we did for cancer patient and give them the best coping strategies and we will show them what daily routine the should follow for better results in other section.
They can also share their experience in one section they can either type or we can use speech recognition.

RISK FACTORS OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS

*Risk Factors You Cannot Change*
   
1. Getting older.> The risk for breast cancer increases with age; most breast cancers are diagnosed after age 50.

2. Genetic mutations.> Inherited changes (mutations) to certain genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. Women who have inherited these genetic changes are at higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

3. Reproductive history.> Early menstrual periods before age 12 and starting menopause after age 55 expose women to hormones longer, raising their risk of getting breast cancer.

4. Having dense breasts.> Dense breasts have more connective tissue than fatty tissue, which can sometimes make it hard to see tumors on a mammogram. Women with dense breasts are more likely to get breast cancer.

5. Personal history of breast cancer or certain non-cancerous breast diseases.> Women who have had breast cancer are more likely to get breast cancer a second time. Some non-cancerous breast diseases such as atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ are associated with a higher risk of getting breast cancer.

6. Family history of breast or ovarian cancer.> A woman’s risk for breast cancer is higher if she has a mother, sister, or daughter (first-degree relative) or multiple family members on either her mother’s or father’s side of the family who have had breast or ovarian cancer. Having a first-degree male relative with breast cancer also raises a woman’s risk.

7. Previous treatment using radiation therapy.> Women who had radiation therapy to the chest or breasts (like for treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma) before age 30 have a higher risk of getting breast cancer later in life.

8. Women who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES),> which was given to some pregnant women in the United States between 1940 and 1971 to prevent miscarriage, have a higher risk. Women whose mothers took DES while pregnant with them are also at risk.

*Risk Factors You Can Change*

1. Not being physically active.> Women who are not physically active have a higher risk of getting breast cancer.

2. Being overweight or obese after menopause.> Older women who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting breast cancer than those at a normal weight.

3. Taking hormones.> Some forms of hormone replacement therapy (those that include both estrogen and progesterone) taken during menopause can raise risk for breast cancer when taken for more than five years. Certain oral contraceptives (birth control pills) also have been found to raise breast cancer risk.

4. Reproductive history.> Having the first pregnancy after age 30, not breastfeeding, and never having a full-term pregnancy can raise breast cancer risk.

5. Drinking alcohol.> Studies show that a woman’s risk for breast cancer increases with the more alcohol she drinks.

Research suggests that other factors such as smoking, being exposed to chemicals that can cause cancer, and changes in other hormones due to night shift working also may increase breast cancer risk.

-> SOME METHODS TO HELP CANCER PATIENTS TO COPING UP WITH THE DEPRESSION

1. Exercise.> Regular exercise can be as effective at treating depression as medication. Not only does exercise boost serotonin, endorphins, and other feel-good brain chemicals, it triggers the growth of new brain cells and connections, just like antidepressants do. Best of all, you don’t have to train for a marathon in order to reap the benefits. Even a half-hour daily walk can make a big difference. For maximum results, aim for 30 to 60 minutes of aerobic activity on most days.

2. Social support.> Strong social networks reduce isolation, a key risk factor for depression. Keep in regular contact with friends and family, or consider joining a class or group. Volunteering is a wonderful way to get social support and help others while also helping yourself.

3. Nutrition.> Eating well is important for both your physical and mental health. Eating small, well-balanced meals throughout the day will help you keep your energy up and minimize mood swings. While you may be drawn to sugary foods for the quick boost they provide, complex carbohydrates are a better choice. They’ll get you going without the all-too-soon sugar crash.

4. Sleep.> Sleep has a strong effect on mood. When you don’t get enough sleep, your depression symptoms will be worse. Sleep deprivation exacerbates irritability, moodiness, sadness, and fatigue. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep each night. Very few people do well on less than seven hours a night. Aim for somewhere between seven to nine hours each night.

5. Stress reduction.> Make changes in your life to help manage and reduce stress. Too much stress exacerbates depression and puts you at risk for future depression. Take the aspects of your life that stress you out, such as work overload or unsupportive relationships, and find ways to minimize their impact.

6. Relaxation techniques.> As well as helping to relieve symptoms of depression, relaxation techniques may also reduce stress and boost feelings of joy and well-being. Try yoga, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation.

7. Acupuncture.> Acupuncture, the technique of using fine needles on specific points on the body for therapeutic purposes, is increasingly being investigated as a treatment for depression, with some research studies showing promising results. If you decide to try acupuncture, make sure that you find a licensed qualified professional.
